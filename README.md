## A website to display all the concerts around the user's area.

TODO LIST:
- [ ] Create a Page that allows user to sign up/login. This will be implemented using FireBase and JS for the backend.
- [x] Use Ticket Master API to fetch the concert details and display it.
- [x] Add a view seatings button where the user will be redirected to the ticket master page to show seating options
- [x] Allow the user to enter a specific city and then display the concenrt based on location.
