## A website to display all the concerts around the user's area.

TODO LIST:
- [ ] Create a Page that allows user to sign up/login. This will be implemented using FireBase and JS for the backend
- [ ] Use Ticket Master API to fetch the concert details and display it
- [ ] Allow the user to enter a specific city and then display the concenrt based on location
- [ ] Future Implementation: Make user choose specific genres and recommend concerts based on that. They will be able to create profiles and record what concerts they have attended so far and future ones they plan to attend.
