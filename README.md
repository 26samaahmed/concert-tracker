TODO LIST:
- [ ] Create a Page that allows user to sign up/login. This will be implemented using FireBase and JS for the backend.
- [x] Use Ticket Master API to fetch the concert details and display it.
- [x] Add a view seatings button where the user will be redirected to the ticket master page to show seating options
- [x] Allow the user to enter a specific city and then display the concenrt based on location.
- [x] Work on UI using a new framework.

- [ ] List the artist's top song under their event card for people to preview if they don't know the artist.
- [ ] Future Implementation: Make user choose specific genres and recommend concerts based on that. They will be able to create profiles and record what concerts they have attended so far and future ones they plan to attend. This can be put on a dashboard.

# create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/main/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
